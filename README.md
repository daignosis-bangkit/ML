Daignosis - Diagnose a disease with AI

How if you only need to type your condition right now, and you can get your diagnosis?

Doesn't it make you able to check your health anytime anywhere easily just from the touch on your phone?

Now, itâ€™s not only a daydream anymore. As one of the product capstone projects from Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka, me and my amazing team have developed an AI powered app that makes it possible.

Let me introduce you to the whole team.
We have:
Dito Iqbal Kusuma in Mobile Development
Yvette Celia Aviani, Zeta Prawira Syah, Emiliano Jossie in Machine learning
Azfar Wisnu and Ilham Maulana in Cloud computing
